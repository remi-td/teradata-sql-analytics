# tdsql-mcp

An MCP server that turns Teradata Vantage into a full-stack analytics agent platform — giving AI agents not just SQL execution, but a structured, hierarchical knowledge base of Teradata's native function ecosystem.

## What This Is

Most database MCP servers provide query execution. This one goes further: it equips agents with the knowledge they need to use Teradata *correctly and optimally* — not just to run arbitrary SQL, but to reach for the right native distributed function for each step of an analytics workflow.

Teradata Vantage includes hundreds of built-in table operators for ML, statistics, data preparation, text analytics, and vector search. These run distributed across all AMPs in parallel and consistently outperform equivalent hand-written SQL. The challenge for agents is *discovery* — knowing these functions exist, knowing which one to use, and knowing how to combine them into pipelines.

This server solves that with a structured syntax reference library and an agent guidance architecture that directs models toward native functions at every decision point.

---

## Why This Matters

The conventional pattern for AI-assisted analytics looks like this:

```
Agent pulls data → processes in Python / LLM context → returns result
```

This works at small scale but collapses under real-world conditions: the data transfer is expensive, the LLM context fills with raw data instead of insights, results are ephemeral and non-reproducible, and nothing produced is reusable at scale.

The in-database approach enabled by this server inverts that model:

```
Agent orchestrates SQL → analytics execute on the platform → only results returned
```

### Zero Data Movement

Native Teradata table operators execute where the data lives — across all AMPs in parallel. No rows are transferred to a client for processing. Whether the operation is computing summary statistics on a billion-row table, fitting a XGBoost model, or running a vector similarity search, the data stays on the platform. What crosses the wire is the result, not the input.

This isn't just a performance consideration. It eliminates a class of problems: no serialization overhead, no memory pressure on the client, no network bottleneck, no privacy risk from data leaving the platform boundary.

### Token and Context Efficiency

When an agent pulls raw data into its context window to analyze it, it burns tokens on data that a SQL function could process in a single pass. A table of a million rows passed to an LLM for statistical analysis is a context window catastrophe. The same analysis via `TD_UnivariateStatistics` returns a compact result set — a handful of rows — that the agent can reason about directly.

This means the agent's context stays clean: **the LLM reasons about results, not raw data**. Fewer tokens consumed. Longer, more coherent conversations. More headroom for complex multi-step workflows.

### AMP-Parallel Performance and Repeatability

Teradata's native analytics functions are not ordinary SQL — they are massively parallel table operators distributed across the AMP architecture. A `TD_XGBoost` training call, a `TD_KMeans` clustering run, or a `TD_ColumnTransformer` preprocessing pass all execute across every AMP simultaneously. The agent gets the benefit of the platform's full parallel compute without orchestrating any of it.

Repeatability follows naturally from this model. Fit functions persist their learned parameters to named tables. Model training persists model weights. The same `TD_ScaleTransform` applied with the same `ScaleFitTable` produces identical output every time — on training data, on new batches, or on a single incoming row. This is not incidental; it is a structural property of the Fit/Transform and Train/Predict patterns built into the library.

### From Agent Session to Operational Pipeline

The highest-value outcome of this architecture is not ad-hoc analysis — it is the transition from agent-assisted exploration to a production SQL pipeline that runs independently at any scale and concurrency.

The CTE prediction pipeline pattern captures this directly:

```sql
-- This query is a complete operational scoring pipeline.
-- It requires no Python, no client-side processing, no agent at runtime.
-- Any process with database access can call it.
WITH transformed AS (
    SELECT * FROM TD_ColumnTransformer(
        ON db.incoming_data AS InputTable
        ON db.impute_fit    AS ImputeFitTable        DIMENSION
        ON db.encode_fit    AS OneHotEncodingFitTable DIMENSION
        ON db.scale_fit     AS ScaleFitTable          DIMENSION
    ) AS t
)
SELECT * FROM TD_XGBoostPredict(
    ON transformed AS InputTable
    ON db.fraud_model AS ModelTable DIMENSION
    USING IDColumn('txn_id') Accumulate('amount', 'merchant')
) AS dt;
```

An agent builds and validates this pipeline. Once it works, it is promoted to a view, a stored procedure, or a scheduled job. The agent is no longer in the loop at inference time. The pipeline runs in-situ, at the platform's full scale and concurrency, against whatever volume of incoming data the business requires.

This is the progression this server is designed to enable: **exploration → validation → operationalization** — entirely within Teradata, without the data ever leaving the platform.

### Library Architecture

The library is structured in three layers, matching how agents reason about analytics problems:

```
guidelines.md          ← "What native function covers this operation?"
                          Canonical mapping of 50+ common operations to native functions.
                          Agents consult this first, before writing any SQL.

index.md               ← Topic directory + Workflows section
                          Maps common use cases (fraud detection, clustering, NLP, etc.)
                          to ordered topic sequences. Agents load topics in the right order.

<topic>.md files       ← Detailed syntax for each function or domain
                          Full argument reference, output schemas, usage patterns,
                          and complete pipeline examples.
```

An agent tackling a fraud detection problem can navigate this hierarchy:
1. Load `guidelines` — confirms `TD_XGBoost`, `TD_ScaleFit`, `TD_SMOTE`, `TD_ClassificationEvaluator` are the right tools
2. Load `index` — finds the Classification workflow topic sequence
3. Load `data-prep`, `ml-functions`, `model-evaluation` in order
4. Assemble the pipeline using the CTE prediction pipeline pattern from `ml-patterns`

### Pipeline Patterns

A key capability is the **CTE prediction pipeline** — a fully encapsulated scoring pipeline that applies all preprocessing and scoring in a single SQL query, with no intermediate tables:

```sql
WITH transformed AS (
    SELECT id, feat1, feat2, feat3_encoded, feat4_scaled, target_col
    FROM TD_ColumnTransformer(
        ON db.new_data AS InputTable
        ON db.impute_fit     AS ImputeFitTable        DIMENSION
        ON db.encoding_fit   AS OneHotEncodingFitTable DIMENSION
        ON db.scale_fit      AS ScaleFitTable          DIMENSION
    ) AS t
)
SELECT * FROM TD_XGBoostPredict(
    ON transformed AS InputTable
    ON db.my_model AS ModelTable DIMENSION
    USING IDColumn('id') Accumulate('target_col')
) AS dt;
```

The saved FitTables and model table are built once at training time and reused indefinitely — enabling reproducible, versioned inference pipelines entirely in-database.

## Usage

### Claude Desktop

Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teradata": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["tdsql-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URI": "teradata://myuser:mypassword@myhost/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With extra parameters (LDAP auth + encryption):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teradata": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["tdsql-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URI": "teradata://myuser:mypassword@myhost/mydb?logmech=LDAP&encryptdata=true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Using a local virtual environment (instead of `uvx`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "teradata": {
      "command": "/path/to/tdsql-mcp/.venv/bin/tdsql-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URI": "teradata://myuser:mypassword@myhost/mydb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/tdsql-mcp` with the absolute path to where you cloned the repo. The `.venv/bin/tdsql-mcp` script is created automatically when you run `pip install -e .` inside the venv.

For read-only mode, add `--read-only` to `args`:

```json
"args": ["--read-only"]
```

### Running directly

```bash
# Install
pip install tdsql-mcp

# Via environment variable
DATABASE_URI="teradata://me:secret@myhost/mydb" tdsql-mcp

# Via CLI flag
tdsql-mcp --uri "teradata://me:secret@myhost/mydb"

# With extra connection parameters
tdsql-mcp --uri "teradata://me:secret@myhost/mydb?logmech=LDAP&sslmode=VERIFY-FULL"

# Read-only
tdsql-mcp --uri "teradata://me:secret@myhost/mydb" --read-only
```

### Install from source (with virtual environment)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ksturgeon-td/tdsql-mcp.git
cd tdsql-mcp

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install in editable mode
# Code and syntax file changes take effect immediately — no reinstall needed
pip install -e .

# Set up your connection credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set DATABASE_URI to your Teradata connection string

# Run the server
tdsql-mcp
```

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:

```bash
deactivate
```

To install from the pinned `requirements.txt` snapshot instead of resolving fresh dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . --no-deps
```

## Extending the Syntax Library

The library is designed to grow. To add a new topic:

1. Create `src/tdsql_mcp/syntax/<topic>.md`
2. Add an entry to `index.md`
3. Add relevant mappings to `guidelines.md`

No code changes needed — the tool auto-discovers `.md` files at call time. Topics planned for future addition include `time-series-patterns.md`, `json-functions.md`, and `geospatial.md`.

---

## Result format

`execute_query` returns:

```json
{
  "rows": [{"col1": "val", "col2": 42}, ...],
  "row_count": 100,
  "truncated": true
}
```

`truncated: true` means more rows were available beyond the `max_rows` limit. Increase `max_rows` or add a `TOP N` / `WHERE` clause to your query.

## Notes

- The server establishes a persistent connection on startup and automatically reconnects on failure.
- `execute_query` defaults to `max_rows=100` to keep token usage manageable. Maximum is 10,000.
- Use `explain_query` before running unfamiliar queries — Teradata's EXPLAIN validates syntax and shows the execution plan without actually running the query.
- All logging goes to stderr; stdout is reserved for the MCP JSON-RPC protocol.
